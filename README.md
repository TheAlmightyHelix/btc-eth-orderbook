# BTC/ETH Orderbook

A functioning real time orderbook in a hypothetical trading platform. The orderbook consists of two sides: the bids/buy side and the asks/sell side. Both sides contain information about the amount of open orders i n the market at each price level.

Order levels are sorted using the price in either ascending or descending order depending on the orientation of the orderbook.

A hosted version of the project can be found [here](https://yuheng-nov10.vercel.app/)
